**_Philippians 3:3-6._** _For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh— **4** though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: **5** circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; **6** as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless._

**Reflection**. It would be very easy to make this devotional about _sola fidei_, justification by faith alone (see these posts on **Romans** and **Galatians**). After all, Paul refers to both “confidence in the flesh” (3:3, 4) and “righteousness based on the law” (3:6). However, he Paul concludes that he had no righteousness of his own through the law but “the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith” in Christ. It would be unfortunate to miss this great truth—the jewel of the Reformation. On the other hand, it would be equally regrettable to force this chapter of Philippians into the faith versus works distinction (**see 2:12-13**). For such a handling would miss other important details along with the historical context.

For starters, Paul hints at the historical context in his odd claim, “it is we who are the circumcision” (3:3). As we saw **last week**, this epistle was written to safeguard Christian joy (3:1), protecting the Philippians from certain “mutilators of the flesh” (3:2). Thus I offered the tentative conclusion that Paul was aware of false teaching or practise that threatened the Philippians’ faith, which was for Paul a source of tremendous joy. This group of false teachers has been labelled the ‘circumcision party’—would you vote for them? Anyway. They seemed to be advocating for either circumcision for Gentile converts or more broadly placing all Christian believers under the weight of Jewish, Old Testament law. This is why Paul emphasises confidence in the flesh together with his own circumcision, Israelite heritage or ethnicity, law keeping, and the prized designation: Pharisee (3:5). He also zealously persecuted Christians, which he saw as commensurate with righteousness and not incompatible with the law (3:6). Even though Paul is using his CV to set up a contrast with faith (3:7-9), we should not skip over his description of believers prior that list.

After calling Christians the “circumcision,” Paul goes on, “it is we…who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh (3:3). Thus while Paul is making little of all confidence birthed from the flesh - which ranges from ethnicity to ethics - he is positively portraying true Christian faith. In other words, faith is not simply the empty handed trust in Christ but extends to service of God by the Spirit and boasting in Christ. The first of those will not surprise anyone who’s been following these devotionals or reading Philippians—selfless service in many ways sums up the epistle. But what might it mean to “boast in Christ Jesus” (also see 1:26; 2:16)?

We might say a few things, which you can to tease out further. Boasting cannot mean pride. Simply consider what we read either side of 3:3, service of others and having no confidence in oneself. Boasting in Christ therefore excludes bragging about oneself, your accomplishments, accolades and achievements. Rather, it makes much of Christ. Paradoxically then, this boasting involves humility. Of course, that is far easier said than done. Furthermore, pride is typically deep rooted and elusive. Perhaps this explains Paul’s seemingly excessive credentials (3:5-6). He had more than most to fuel proud boasts. Many people would have coveted his ancestry, upbringing, religious fervour and success. But Paul’s boast was Christ Jesus. Is he yours? I know that I am regularly tempted to ‘supplement' Christ with my own human triumphs and strengths. While I halfheartedly boast in Christ I do two things: firstly, I reveal my insecurity in Christ; secondly, I subtly try to make more of myself and my own “reasons” for confidence in the flesh.

The ‘humble brag’ can be heard in many conversations and seen pasted all over social media. This 21st century **epigram** describes self-deprecating statements designed to draw attention to something the speaker is actually proud about. **For example**… But that isn’t what Paul is doing here. This becomes especially apparent when you read on to hear him calling these things “loss” and “garbage” (3:8). Here is evidence of someone who genuinely boasts in Christ—and therefore nothing else. To boast in Christ surely means both thinking little of all our achievements and making little of them too. For the person who boasts in Christ is proudly his, and they do not fear failing to succeed in the eyes of the world.
