This post will serve as the final installation in my series on the Old Testament book of Kings. The purpose throughout has been to apply this Old Testament theology of leadership to modern Christian leadership. My **previous post** considered Solomon’s ironic military success—together with Omri’s. In both examples we learn that man's measures of success in ministry and church leadership may not necessarily align with God’s. Ministries, like kingdoms, may appear successful and mighty while failing to succeed in the ways that God has laid out. This concluding post will reiterate that point by reflecting on Sheba’s visit, before sounding one final warning about succeeding in Christian ministry but failing as a follower of Christ. After all, Jesus tells us to be on guard against gaining the world but losing our souls.

What becomes apparent reading through 1 Kings 1-11 is Solomon’s remarkable success, in almost every realm, which was very likely the result of astute **political manoeuvring**. But as Walter Brueggemann comments on Sheba’s visit (1 Kings 10:1-13), “The chief claim of the wise Solomon is his **economic prosperity**.” **\[centres\]** Both Solomon and Israel had prospered tremendously during his reign (10:7). Solomon’s reputation was immense and the nation was great (10:6). Thus Sheba travelled to marvel and pay homage. Yet Brueggemann asks, “From the perspective of worldly powers, who would have asked for more?” In other words, of course Sheba would have been struck by Solomon’s success as a leader, for he achieved those things that the world pursues. But despite this shiny gloss on Solomon’s kingdom, this series has argued that gaping cracks were showing. So Sheba’s plaudits ring hollow and somewhat ironically. Immediately after her visit, the author reiterates Solomon’s staggering wealth (10:14-29; **cf. Deuteronony 17**). Shortly after that, Solomon’s devastating idolatry is explicitly narrated (11:1-8).

At high school I studied Shakespeare. One of the dramatic devices Bill liberally employed was ‘appearance versus reality.’ Very simply, 'appearance versus reality’ describes an ambiguous assessment of a situation. On the surface things _appear_ one way. But in _reality_ there is more going on. It just so happens, that biblical narratives use a similar device, and not a small amount of **irony**. Therefore many Old Testament scholars argue that 1 Kings 10 should be read on two levels. Sheba’s fawning admiration and praise appears to suggest that Solomon was truly blessed by Yahweh—a successful and faithful king. But the reality is that his reign is marked by a selfish centralisation project, excessive comfort at the expense of his people, and shameless as well as ruthless self-preservation. Sheba’s plaudits should be read in light of where they originate: worldly ambition. We need only note what she celebrates: power, prosperity, political might, and success.

But, you may ask, what about 10:9? “Because the Yahweh loved Israel forever, he has made you king, that you may execute justice and righteousness.” These are, after all, distinctly covenantal words. They are also similar to the reason Yahweh granted Solomon wisdom (see 3:28). At this point you will have to forgive my technical jargon, the Hebrew of 10:9 is a purpose clause rather than an indicative statement. In other words, Sheba is reminding Solomon what God’s purpose was in appointing him. However this was not necessarily what he did. For example, speed limits exist with the purpose of creating safer roads. Yet this is only the case when those limits are obeyed. Likewise, Yahweh established Solomon to execute justice and righteousness. Whether he did or not is another question.

Yahweh made Solomon wise so that he might rule righteously and lead Israel to fidelity, unwavering worship of Yahweh. Instead, Sheba describes the king’s court as a place where Solomon is eerily enshrined (10:8). He sits perched on an extravagant throne. The pagan queen is attracted to the things she longed for in her own kingdom. Therefore neither her nor Solomon pursue Yahweh’s vision for a distinctly other type of leader over God’s people.

Paying attention to these details and others like it in the Solomon narrative paints a slightly different picture to the simple rise and fall pattern—with Solomon supposedly starting well and finishing badly. Yes, the narrative pivots at 1 Kings 7, while the most explicitly damning narration begins at 11:1. Yet it is almost as if the narrator plays Solomon’s piety off against his pomp. We might try to excuse Solomon’s inconsistencies as marks of mere humanity: clay feet. Only we must not forget that this section of the Old Testament is acutely interested in leadership of God’s people. Thus Solomon’s failings are not condoned by appeals to his humanity. They serve as warnings about fraught and selfish leadership. Though the narrative reserves its most telling criticisms for 1 Kings 11, the seeds of Solomon’s ruin and its entailments for Israel were sown long before this conclusive moment.

Writing in the first century, Paul exhorted a church elder to watch his life and doctrine closely (1 Timothy 4:16). In my tradition we champion the latter: precise and articulate doctrine. Yet more pastors fail in ministry because of immorality rather than the lure of theological liberalism. As we have seen, Solomon’s later indiscriminate idolatry is no surprise. It was the inevitable culmination of a life spent flirting with serious sin, dabbling in disobedience and ultimately creating a kingdom that centred on himself rather than Yahweh. The almost endless string of high profile pastors being embroiled in sexual scandals or accused of spiritual abuse is telling. These were leaders whose doctrine was sound—their theology checked out. However, in many of these cases, it was unchecked vices and unchallenged sin that was given time to flourish.

Life is full of surprises, isn’t it? But the cataclysmic fallout following years of unrepentant sin is not one of them. Haven’t you read James 1:15-16? “Sin when it is fully grown brings forth death. Do not be deceived.” But sin is both delightful and deceptive. And in the end it can be deadly. I’m not advocating for some kind of witch-hunt among Christian leaders. Nor am I browbeating those same leaders. Rather, we should all remember, in the words of John Owen, “Know that he that dares to dally with occasions of sin will dare to sin..If it have allowance for one step, it will take another.”
