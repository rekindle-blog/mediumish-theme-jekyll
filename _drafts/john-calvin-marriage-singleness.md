My [first post](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2020-11-12-1-corinthians-7-is-it-better-to-marry "Is is better to marry?") in this series looked at 1 Corinthians 7, considering the somewhat famous 7:9, "It’s better to marry than to burn with passion." I noted that throughout 1 Corinthians 7 Paul commends celibacy, or singleness, calling it a good gift from God (7:7-8). On the other hand Paul seems to make a concession for marriage, possibly even suggesting that it is not the Christian ideal. For most Christians living in the 21st century, Paul’s comments are unpalatable—if not roundly absurd. We dance around the implications of 1 Corinthians 7 by [tenuous appeals to the historical context](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2020-11-18-1-corinthians-7 "The 'Corinthian problem'") or situation. But ultimately I think that most of us reject the biblical teaching that clearly says singleness or celibacy is good because we have a made an idol out of romance, marriage, and the nuclear family. At the same time we conflate singleness with loneliness.

But the church’s fixation on marriage does possess certain theological justifications and biblical support. In this post I want to trace out two of these. Incidentally, both of them are evident in John Calvin's [_Institutes_](https://ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes/institutes?queryID=6908343&resultID=698 "Calvin's Institutes (free online)")_._ **Outline**

## 1. Does Marriage Complete Us?

Calvin alludes to Genesis 2:18, “It is not good that the man should be alone,” writing “Man has been created in this condition that he may not lead a solitary life, but may enjoy a helper joined to himself” (2.8.41). Calvin believes that our created nature is conditioned towards marriage (2.8.42). Calvin is not entirely wrong—he very rarely is. However, I want to tease out one problem with this statement. We were created to glorify God, regardless of life station. This post will become too long if attempt to unpack both of these, so I will focus on the second.

Were we created for marriage? Is marriage fundamental to our humanity? If the answer to these questions is yes, are we ontologically or essentially incomplete until we are joined to a spouse? Putting aside the fact that the most fully human person to ever live - Jesus Christ - was single, let us consider Genesis 2. Yahweh does say, “It is not good that the man should be alone” (2:18). But we should what follows, both in what Yahweh’s solution to Adam being alone is and in how the text goes on to speak about human marriage.

Immediately after Yahweh declares something, for the very first time, to be “not good” we are told that he provides Adam with a “helper” (2:18). But, in his commentary on Genesis, Robert Alter notes, “‘Help’ is too weak because it suggests merely an auxiliary function,” when the Hebrew word “connotes active intervention on behalf of someone, especially in military contexts” (see Isaiah 30:5; Ezekiel 12:14). “It seems to express the notion of complementarity rather than identity” (Wenham). Thus being a spouse is not fundamental to our humanity. We were not created for marriage. Of course, as Alter writes [elsewhere](http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/rediscovering-the-art-of-biblical-narrative/ "Alter: The Art Of Biblical Narrative"), what sets man apart determines his loneliness. But surely marriage is not the only place companionship can be found.

Following from the above point, we must read further in the Genesis narrative to complete our picture of marriage. Does marriage complete a man or a woman? Can we swap out “not good” for ‘incomplete’? This is what many ancient Greeks thought, such as Plato. In _The Symposium,_ Plato views lovers as bifurcated halves in pursuit of wholeness and completion. Some have suggested that the Genesis 2 narrative conveys a similar notion when it says, “they shall become one flesh” (2:24). The image of “one flesh” is of course a vivid glimpse of the sex act, for they were naked together but unashamed (2:25). But in 2:25 our English translations possibly obscure an important detail in the Hebrews. For Alter notes that 2:24 emphatically concludes with the word “one,” yet 2:25 awkwardly doubles back on this by referring to ‘the man and his woman’ as ‘two’ (not “both”). Despite their remarkable intimacy in sex constituting “one flesh,” man and woman remain two. They do not form one, as incomplete halves seeking wholeness.

## 2. Does Marriage Prevent Sexual Sin?

Let us get back to John Calvin’s _Institutes_ and 1 Corinthians 7. Despite the issues I’ve outlined above regarding our created purpose, as man and woman, there is a more significant weakness in Calvin's presentation. This might be summarised as overemphasising sin while not giving enough weight to gospel events—especially the coming of the Spirit. Big claims, indeed.

Calvin writes, inferring Genesis 3, “The companionship of marriage has been ordained as a necessary remedy to keep us from plunging into unbridled lust” (2.8.42). Calvin suggests that sin compounds our created nature meaning we “should turn to matrimony to help them preserve their chastity in the degree of their calling.” He goes on to discuss 1 Corinthians 7, specifically celibacy writing, “It is not given to every man to keep chastity in celibacy, even if he aspires to it with great zeal and effort” (2.8.43). Thus, for Calvin, marriage is doubly necessary owing to our (a) created and (b) sinful natures.

As I have already alluded, Calvin seems to make our sinfulness, or fallen nature, more fundamental than our new natures in Christ along with renewed desires through the power of the Spirit. Can we really say that a man who struggles with lust but chooses celibacy, or singleness, is contending with God? Calvin thinks so. Within God’s command for sexual purity he says each person must measure their own abilities. Still in 2.8.43 he writes, “Let no man rashly despise marriage as something unprofitable or superfluous to him; let no man long for celibacy unless he can live without a wife…Let every man abstain from marriage only so long as he is fit to observe celibacy.” Is marriage really necessary for the man, or woman, who struggles with lust? Again, Calvin thinks so writing, “If his power to tame lust fails him, let him recognise that the Lord has now imposed the necessary of marriage upon him.”

I am sympathetic towards Calvin’s pastoral intentions. For he highlights the seriousness with which we should treat sexual sin—a commitment to sexual purity that is desperately lacking in many churches today (Ephesians 5:3). However, I am unconvinced by his view of marriage as a refuge and remedy to unchastity or lust. Untamed sexual desires are not remedied by marriage. Temptation does not disappear with the advent marital sex. Nor is lust sated. Singles and marrieds must respectively pursue holiness and sexual purity while putting sin to death.
