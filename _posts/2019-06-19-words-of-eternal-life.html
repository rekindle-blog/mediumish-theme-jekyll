<p>After a particularly challenging sermon during Jesus’ earthly ministry we are told, “many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him” (John 6:66). Some of Jesus’ followers found his teaching hard to hear and considered it an unbearable burden (6:60). After many of the crowd had left, Jesus invited "the twelve” to go with them (6:67). Simon Peter’s response to Jesus’ invitation is one that I wish I believed as firmly as the apostle clearly did. He starts by answering Jesus’ question with his own question, “Lord, to whom shall we go?” (6:68). But notice that Simon Peter is not merely drawn to some aspect of Jesus’ personality. He cannot envision departing from Christ because, as he continues, “You have the words of eternal life” (6:68).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/galatians-the-lords-anointed-may-be-accursed/iconpeter/" rel="attachment wp-att-2487"><img class="wp-image-2487 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Iconpeter-200x300.jpg" alt="Icon St Peter" width="278" height="417" /></a>I wish I believed Peter’s words more often. Even now, as I am writing this blog post, it is the end of another day in which I have demonstrated that I do not believe God’s words to be significant, let alone the words of eternal life. Sure I am a full-time theological student, and I can ease my conscience by reminding myself that I spent the day poring over rich theology. But that does not mean I spent any time today treasuring Christ, or acting in such a way that imitates Peter’s convictions. Peter goes on to say, “We have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God” (6:69). In the Gospels, <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/galatians-the-lords-anointed-may-be-accursed/">despite his numerous failings and follies</a>, Peter is a man devoted to Christ. In John 6 we see that his commitment to Christ brought with it a commitment to his words.</p>
<p>Earlier in the same section, Jesus said, “The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life” (6:63). Of course, the Bible teaches us, as this passages does, that this life is tied to the work of God the Father (6:65), as well as the Holy Spirit (6:63). This observation should challenge Christians who imagine the Spirit to work separately from God’s Word, which I have done <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/john-calvin-on-scripture-the-letter-killeth/">elsewhere</a>. We could also make a Trinitarian observation here, that the work of the three persons - Father, Son and Spirit - are <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/the-agency-of-definitive-sanctification-father-son-and-holy-spirit/">inseparable</a>. But these segues would only distract us from the topic at hand: Jesus’ words give and sustain life; or as Peter understood, Jesus had the words of eternal life.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/bonhoeffer-on-scripture-gods-true-and-sufficient-word-for-christians/people-book-girl-sitting-alone-reading-rock/" rel="attachment wp-att-2988"><img class="wp-image-2988 alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/www.maxpixel.net-People-Book-Girl-Sitting-Alone-Reading-Rock-2604837-236x300.jpg" alt="Devotional" width="305" height="388" /></a>Unfortunately, as is evident from my own experience and many readers’ too, I am sure, we struggle to appropriate this truth in at least two ways. The first is not a little ironic, we allow the busyness of life to keep us from the words of eternal life. Years ago I would frequent a second hand Christian book store not far from where I lived. The owner of that shop traded in the embarrassing acronyms sadly associated with Christians. One of his favourites was Bible: Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth. I still shudder thinking about it. Peter was not hanging out with Jesus hoping for a couple of helpful throwaways and guidelines—certainly not acronyms. Peter clung to Jesus because his words were eternal life, spiritually sustaining and life changing in the present. I imagine if we told Peter that our lives are too busy to mediate on Jesus’ words he would be confused because those words are life.</p>
<p>Another way I often show I do not share Peter’s evaluation of God’s truth is when I am faced with other options. Unlike the above point, this occurs when I have too much rather than too little time. For example, it is Saturday afternoon and my son and wife are taking a nap. The way our weekends go it is likely that this is the only time I will get to myself on any given Saturday. What should I do with that time? I regularly struggle to give up that time because I wrongly turn to other life-giving things: recreational reading, exercise or blogging. Yes, those things are good gifts from God, and you likely have your own, but if Peter and Jesus are correct in our passage, are we overlooking one of God’s greatest gifts? Let us say with Peter, “You have the words of eternal life”. Then let us delight in them, be sustained by them and desire to know God better through his Word.</p>
